						Hello everyone, My name is Vijeta Priya and I am a third year bachelor at NIT Agartala.
						I am a passionate Competitve Programmer and my Dream is to reach ICPC. Recently, I have learned the wonders of Development. So, tried my 
						hands at Front-end Dev and building Static Pages. After that, I got interested in Game Developer. So, made a multiplayer PACMAN [again a static Page].
						I have a good knowledge of Python and had made some Desktop Applications with Tkinter.
						Also, I am an open-source contributer.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Before this, in the last two years, I worked in almost all technical clubs of my University.
						I made RC Planes, Drones and piloted them. I also gave workshops to presentations to teach my fellowBatchmates about the working of Planes AeroDynamics.
						I am a proud member of ANARC[Robotics Club], ANIMA [Aero & Aviation Club] and DCC [Developer and Coders Club] of our college. Following a brief tenure in Sangnam Prayog[AeroSpace] Club.
						I have also made a Solar Tracking Device with the help of my team at ANARC and Arduino.
